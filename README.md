In this project I will be applying the basics of HTML and CSS by creating a replica of the Google homepage.

To begin with, I made myself an outline of the path I needed to follow by creating a requirements text file, so in case at some points I didn't know
what exactly to do I could refer to this, I also did this to prevent getting sidetracked. 
Afterwards I gave myself a refresher on git commands, after my first 2 initial commits and my first push, I realised that the text I label my commits
with is way too long, so I created a mental note of that and am writing very short and as defining as possible comments from now.
On to the webpage, I created a skeleton structure of the webpage. Initially I had some difficulty designing what sort of elements I needed to use to reflect
the content on the actual Google homepage but eventually I realised that most of the content on the page is anchors, for which I used buttons initially.
After finishing the layout I encountered my first problem. I had absolutely no idea how to position items properly, other than some basic concepts on
position types. I looked up ways of how to position items on Google and I would always notice the flexbox. In the back of my head I had this constant thought
that I would never understand the concept of flexboxes, or at least not this soon. After much trial and error, realising that I'm probably doing this the wrong
way, I did end up using flexboxes and it actually turned out to be quite an enjoyable experience since it is much easier than it appears, you just need to experiment
with the many different property values to achieve the desired result. Most of the time during the positioning I used ID's, not sure if this is the best option
but it worked for me. Eventually, the elements were set in place on a certain outline where I wanted them to be. During this process I also used the debugger quite
a lot on the actual google homepage, although it's sometimes hard to tell what you're looking for, I still managed to find the correct information most of the time.
Then came the stilization of the content, which took the most amount of time. During the stiling, I applied a lot of concepts that I learned throughout freecodecamp's
course but I also applied a lot of concepts that I didn't know prior to picking this project up, I achieved this by troubleshooting on Google and using the debugger.
I familiarized myself with the concept of selectors and how they work quite well, became more knowledgeable of some properties, learned new pseudo-classes, applied
prior knowledge on how to stilize with colors, polished my knowledge on how dimensions work and in all honesty, I feel like some of the syntax is becoming second
nature. 

All in all, it was a briliant learning experience on how to make elements behave the way I wanted them to, positioning was the hardest although the other tasks
weren't easy either. During the project, a lot of the time I would get lost in the small details, like how big I want the background color of the gmail avatar to be,
or how I wanted to replicate the site as closely as possible and I feel like it was quite a lot of time wasted because of that, nevertheless if I were to continue working on this, I know exactly what I want to polish and I know for sure that I need to streamline my code.
